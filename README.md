# Bozhidar-Stanchev-employees
Job application task. A simple application that finds two employees who worked together the longest based on input data. Input is a CSV file. Simple UI required for loading the input file and displaying the result.


Feedback:
- the sample input and output are inconsistent and wrong. (the dates for the common project don't overlap)
- there is no explicit mention of what units "period of time" is measured in for the output. I assumed it's days based on the bonus task output requirement.
- there is no definition for "days worked" in the bonus points task. I assumed it's days worked together on each project.
- it's not explained what "all date formats" constitutes. Nor what "support" means.
